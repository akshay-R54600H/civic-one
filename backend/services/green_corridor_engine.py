Green Corridor Engine – turns traffic signals along emergency routes to GREEN.

When an ambulance or emergency vehicle is dispatched, hex cells along the route
are marked as "green corridor". All traffic signals within those hexes are
forced to GREEN until the vehicle passes or the corridor expires.
